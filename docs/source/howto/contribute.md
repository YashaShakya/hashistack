# Contribute

Thanks for asking!

* Read the [](/explanations/conduct_code.md). If you find nothing wrong with following these guidelines, 
you are welcome.
* Read the Github's guide on 
[Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github).
* Start.

## Branching and PR

Please do work from an up-to-date version of the `dev` branch and ensure that you worked out 
every merge conflicts that could appear before creating a pull request:

* __from__ your forked repository work branch
* __into__ the main repository `wescale:dev` branch

## Tests

Github Actions are configured to run only on code that is already in the main repository's branches
to save the free minutes. 

Please run the lint and molecule tests before PR-ing: that'll save back-and-forth modifications.

## Reminder

Thanks a lot for contributing at any level. Have fun!
